No news at all regarding the house :(( We'll be sitting on it till the end of our lives!\r\nLeu: That can't be. It is such a fantastic property. In such an incredibly beautiful estate. It's a matter of time.\r\nLuisa: That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market.\r\nLeu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland.\r\nLuisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night.\r\nLeu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he?\r\nLuisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?!\r\nLeu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight.\r\nLuisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples.\r\nLeu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor.\r\nLuisa: He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him.\r\nLeu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it?\r\nLuisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day.\r\nLeu: Therapy?\r\nLuisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't.\r\nLeu: Nor can I.\r\nLuisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late.\r\nLeu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say.\r\nLuisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree...\r\nLeu: Right you are! \"The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different.\" Do you remember?\r\nLuisa: \"Then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand.

But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.\r\nJeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an \"occasional low cumulative\", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.\r\nMax: Tom You didn’t watch the video.\r\nTom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;)\r\nJason: I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well.\r\nDaniel: Short attention span 😊\r\nMax: Daniel probably from pot 🤷‍♂️\r\nMax: Jason he does - rewatch the end man.

I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...\r\nKen: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.\r\nTom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine\r\nBrian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates.\r\nKen: Really?
